*      spitbol conditional assembly symbols for use by token.spt
*      ---------------------------------------------------------
*
*      this file of conditional symbols will override the conditional
*      definitions contained in the spitbol minimal file.   in addition,
*      lines beginning with ">" are treated as spitbol statements and
*      immediately executed.
*
*      for linux spitbol-x86
*
*      in the spitbol translator, the following conditional
*      assembly symbols are referred to. to incorporate the
*      features referred to, the minimal source should be
*      prefaced by suitable conditional assembly symbol
*      definitions.
*      in all cases it is permissible to default the definitions
*      in which case the additional features will be omitted
*      from the target code.
